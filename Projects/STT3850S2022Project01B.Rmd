### Setup

#### Packages Used

Load all packages used in this project.

```{r loadpackages}

```

#### Dataset Used

Read about the Fast Food dataset on its [description page](https://stat-jet-asu.github.io/Datasets/InstructorDescriptions/fastfood2017.html). In this analysis you will focus specifically on fast food **burgers**.  

* Load the Fast Food 2017 dataset from its URL
* Pipe and `filter()` so the dataset contains only burgers
* Pipe and `select()` only the variables `calories` and `totalfat`
* Pipe and create two new variables with the given names using `mutate()`...
    * `calfromfat`: the total fat calories in each burger (1 gram of fat is 9 calories)
    * `pctfromfat`: the percentage of calories in each burger that come from from fat calories
* Be sure to store your manipulations to the dataset!

Create the dataset.

```{r burgerscreate}

```

Glimpse the dataset.

```{r burgersglimpse}

```

### Analysis

#### **The Context**

Nutritionists recommend against eating fast food because it is high in sodium, saturated fat, trans fat, and cholesterol. Eating too much fast food over a long period of time can lead to health problems, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, or obesity. Many fast-food meals contain more than an entire day's worth of recommended calories and fat! Websites such as [Fast Food Nutrition](https://fastfoodnutrition.org/) track fast food nutrition information.

#### **The Problem**

How many calories do fast food burgers contain? How much of the calorie content comes from fat? How strongly are fat and calories related?

#### **Exploration 1**

Create a frequency polygon with 8 bins and boxplot for `totalfat`. Use `geom_vline()` to add vertical lines to the polygon at 44 and 78 grams, the boundaries of the target range for daily total fat. Compute the upper and lower fences for the boxplot and the deciles of the distribution.

##### Boxplot

##### Fences

##### Deciles

#### **Exploration 2**

Create a frequency polygon with 8 bins and boxplot for `pctfromfat`. Use `geom_vline()` to add vertical lines to the polygon at 20% and 35%, the boundaries of the target range for calories from fat. Compute the upper and lower fences for the boxplot and the deciles of the distribution.

##### Fences

##### Deciles

#### **Exploration 3**

Create a scatterplot for `calfromfat` (Y) by `calories` (X). Compute the correlation coefficient for these two variables.

### Discussion

Question 1: What are the shapes of the distributions of `totalfat` and `pctfromfat`? Does this make sense to you, given the selection of items in the dataset and what these variables represent?

**ANSWER:** --erase this and type your answer here--

Question 2: Menu boards for fast food often list the calorie counts for items. Is the relationship between `calfromfat` and `calories` linear? If so, how strong is the relationship? Do you think we could reasonably predict calories from fat using calories?

**ANSWER:** --erase this and type your answer here--

Question 3: Choose one burger from the article [10 Ridiculously Unhealthy Fast Food Burgers](https://www.thestreet.com/markets/10-ridiculously-unhealthy-fast-food-burgers-12854441) that is not already in the dataset. Where does it fall among the deciles for `totalfat` or `pctfromfat`? Would it be an outlier for either variable?
