### Course Information

**Course Description**

This is an introduction to the programming language R, focused on a powerful set of tools known as the Tidyverse. You'll learn the intertwined processes of data manipulation and visualization using the tools dplyr and ggplot2. You'll learn to manipulate data by filtering, sorting, and summarizing a real dataset of historical country data in order to answer exploratory questions. You'll then learn to turn this processed data into informative line plots, bar plots, histograms, and more with the ggplot2 package. Youâ€™ll get a taste of the value of exploratory data analysis and the power of Tidyverse tools. This is a suitable introduction for those who have no previous experience in R and are interested in performing data analysis.

### Data Wrangling

The gapminder dataset

Notes from the video:

```{r}
# There is no code in this section.
```

Loading the gapminder and dplyr packages

NOTE: These have been loaded above. You only need to load the gapminder and tidyverse libraries (which includes both dplyr and ggplot2) once. There is no need to reload them each time in subsequent exercises.
